I am a college student at Case Western Reserve University. I anticipate graduating with a BS in Computer Science in the Spring of 2017, and a MS in Computer Science in the Spring of 2018.

My professional interests include Data Science and Backend Web Development. Please take a look at some of the projects I've worked on!

My personal interests include running (I am a 800 and 1500 meter runner on CWRU's track and field team), board games, and watching basketball (I root for the Knicks and the 2016 NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers).
