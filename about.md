I am a college student at Case Western Reserve University. I anticipate graduating with a BS in Computer Science in the Spring of 2017, and a MS in Computer Science in the Spring of 2018.

I am passionate about leveraging the power of data to help people make better decisions through software. In the past, I've worked on projects related to Backend Web Development, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization. I'm a great and willing learner, and I will work hard on whatever project is put before me! I built this website to showcase some of the cool projects I've worked on over the years, as well as to give myself a blogging platform. Please take a look around!

My personal interests include running (I am a 800 and 1500 meter runner on CWRU's track and field team), board games, and watching basketball (I root for the Knicks and the 2016 NBA champion Cleveland Cavaliers).
