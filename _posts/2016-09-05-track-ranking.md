In my previous [post](http://joeledger.com/others/2016/08/22/olympic_scraping.html), I demonstrated using the Python requests library to download the results of every Olympics track and field final from the 1896 Athens Olympics to the 2012 London Olmypics. The end result was an 11,000 line text file!

Now that I have these results, I have decided to do some in depth analysis of them. My goal is to determine which athlete had the most impressive performance in an Olympic finals relative to his/her peers.
